ChessAI

The Lofty Orange presents: The unbeatable Chess AI. Woo.

To Thai:

What I did to get this set up was:

Clone the git directory to desktop

Use it to make an Eclipse java project

(Idk if the Eclipse project will take care of this for you or not. I've included it to be sure)
(As long as no errors come up, then you should be good)
	Download the zip file from this link: http://www.java2s.com/Code/JarDownload/java/java-json.jar.zip

	Extract the zip to get the .jar file
	
	Add it to the lib folder
	
	Follow the rest of the directions on this SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8997598/importing-json-into-an-eclipse-project?rq=1
	
	^ Select the external jar from the lib folder
	


Right now, Runnable.java holds the main method. It should run as a java application.
