 * So what I'm thinking for this is to have a board object that holds the

 * similar for my Rubik's cube project, and found that it was actually extremely difficult 
 * to copy the board, without copying the reference as well. For example, if you 
 * perform changes to a copy, those changes will be applied to the original as well.
